## Today's Progress
I took what I learned over the past couple of days and have used it in my Alan Watts API.

## Thoughts
I have added a GET request to my [Express](https://expressjs.com/) routes which lists all of the Alan Watts quotes in my [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) collection, and I have also added a GET request to obtain a specific quote based on the quote's id.

I expanded upon this a little further and I have used [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) to retrieve the quotes, I selected the first quote in the list, and sent only the quote to the browser without any of the addition JSON stuff.

I'm quite pleased with myself.

I'm looking forward to building upon this, and I think I might start adding a bit of [React](https://reactjs.org/) back into the mix so I can build a little frontend for the API.
