## Today's Progress
I have learned more about [Express](https://expressjs.com/), and I attempted the #Javascript30 challenge but I didn't take to it.  I have also brushed upon testing using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org), but I will look more into it tomorrow.

## Thoughts
I am a little disappointed with myself this evening, as I began to lose interest/motivation to proceed.  I did manage to get my hour in, and I attempted to do the #Javascript30 challenge, but I didn't take to the structure of the first video so I stopped and didn't commit to the challenge.

I did start to learn about [Mocha](https://mochajs.org), which I must admit has piqued my interest again, and I am excited to get back to it tomorrow!

I owe my thanks to the kind people of Twitter for their kind words of encouragement.
