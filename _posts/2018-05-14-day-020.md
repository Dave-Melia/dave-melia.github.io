## Today's Progress
I restarted my [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) lessons back to when I started learning about [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/), since I had forgotten what I had previously learned and couldn't remember where I was up to.

## Thoughts
I have have man-flu with a crippling headache and I just could not bring myself to code.  I tried on several occasions to load up the [Atom](https://atom.io/) and I immediately lost motivation.

So, today I am carrying on from Day 20.  I did toy with the idea of starting again from day 1, but I think if I stop for a matter of days again, I will restart.  I'm also pretty sad about losing my streak, especially considering that my day coincided with the day of the month (Day 1 was on the 1st, Day 2 was on the 2nd, etc).

I started back at the start of [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) because I forgot where I was up to and couldn't just jump right in.  See Day 19 for specifically what I have done.

I wish I knew Ruby so I could write a plugin for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to automagically put in these links on keywords because it's a manual process and I already regret starting! :D
