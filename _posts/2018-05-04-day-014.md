## Today's Progress
I delved deeper into [Mocha](https://mochajs.org), and discovered the [Expect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expect) package for assertions.  I also discovered [SuperTest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) for testing [Express](https://expressjs.com/) applications.

## Thoughts
Not a great deal in terms of developing anything this evening, but I have enjoyed learning about Mocha and assertions for testing code.  I learned about testing code, testing async code, and testing [Express](https://expressjs.com/) applications.

I have some more to learn before moving back to developing an application.

Hopefully tomorrow night I should be done with the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) course so I can move on.
