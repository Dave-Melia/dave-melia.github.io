## Today's Progress
Today I finished learning about testing code using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org).  I learned about spies (though, I'll be honest I have no idea what they're for), and I learned about [Rewire](https://github.com/jhnns/rewire) (again, no understanding at all).  I have also dipped my toes into learning [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Thoughts
So, I have finished the testing course, and I am excited to start using it in real-world apps, I am a little confused when it comes to spies and [Rewire](https://github.com/jhnns/rewire).  I'm sure time will help with this.

I also began to learn about [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), which I must admit, I have been really excited about.

I have used SQL over the years, and I have always wanted to learn more about [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), so with a bit of luck, I'll be able to adjust pretty easily.  I suppose the hardest part is getting used to collections, documents, and fields as I'm finding them a little confusing.

I discovered a tool called [RoboMongo](https://robomongo.org/) which provides a GUI for your database; it will help me visualise what is happening behind the scenes whilst I get used to using a NoSQL database.

Next up, is making a 'Todo' API using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).  It's currently 06:15 and I have been up with the baby all night so the API will have to wait until tomorrow!
