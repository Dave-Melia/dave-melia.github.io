## Today's Progress
I have learned more about promises and I have rewritten the weather app using promises instead of callbacks.  I also began learning about Express and have set up a very basic web server with a few routes.

## Thoughts
At first I was a little confused in regards to promises, and to some extent I still am.  After going over a tutorial which explains them in depth, and also how to chain them together, I understand them a little more.  I got to rewrite the weather app using [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) instead of [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) since [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) supports promises, and it took less code to write than the original app did.

As for Express, I have used it before but I didn't understand it from the ground up and I never understood the difference between Node and Express.  Having spent some time with Node, and now moving on to Express, I feel like I understand them both as separate entities.
