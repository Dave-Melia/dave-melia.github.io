## Today's Progress
I took a day off from learning to focus on playing with the Twitch API.

I also learned about promises, but I haven't quite grasped it yet!

## Thoughts
I didn't do as much as I'd like, though I did manage to get my hour in.  I had a rough night with the baby; he currently cries for hours (~3 hours) for no apparent reason and he will only stop when he is being held.

As for the Twitch API... well, I didn't do an awful lot with it, I merely wanted to recreate my weather app, but rather than using the Google API to fetch coordinates, and the Dark Sky API to fetch the weather, I wanted to fetch Twitch data.  At present I'm not overly fussed on the new Helix Twitch API as there is quite a few features missing that were in the previous Kraken version.  I did manage to get the app to list the top 20 games, and it was my intention to display how many viewers each game had at the time of the request.  Needless to say, I retrieved the list of games, and I formatted the results so that it would quite literally display the title of the game, rather than the JSON string containing the cover art etc.
