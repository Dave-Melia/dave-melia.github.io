## Today's Progress
Working more on HTTP requests whilst building the weather app.

I have also learned about encodeURIComponent() as well as decodeURIComponent() which enable me to encode user input (in this case, the address), and replace spaces with %20.  The reverse happens for decodeURIComponent()!  See the links below.
I have also set in place some callback error handling.

## Thoughts
GitHub wasn't logging my contributions for the past couple of days and I've only just realised it's because the author email address on the commits were set to dave@macbook.local rather than my actual email address.  It's a little disappointing because I was going to use the commits as part of my commitment to the challenge, but at least I've realised it early on in the challenge rather than towards the end!
