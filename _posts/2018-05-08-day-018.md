## Today's Progress
Quite a productive day.  I built a [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) app using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/),

## Thoughts
I wanted to see how much information I retained from the course I've been doing over the past couple of weeks, so I set out to create a little app using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) and the Twitch API.

Essentially, I just wanted to display the top 20 games currently being streamed on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/), along with their box art and viewer count.

I managed to do it, but I struggled getting the API passed in to the view, but with thanks to [@nikkilr88](https://twitter.com/nikkilr88) I got it done!  So a big thank you to her!

I finished off the evening with some [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), and [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) was introduced; I'm looking forward to continuing on with that tomorrow!.

The app can be seen here: [Twitch App](https://ancient-bastion-69677.herokuapp.com/)

I'm not very good at design so it's a little bland.
