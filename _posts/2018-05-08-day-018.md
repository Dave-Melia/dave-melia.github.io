## Today's Progress
Quite a productive day.  I built a Node.JS app using Express and Handlebars,

## Thoughts
I wanted to see how much information I retained from the course I've been doing over the past couple of weeks, so I set out to create a little app using Node, Express, Handlebars and the Twitch API.

Essentially, I just wanted to display the top 20 games currently being streamed on Twitch, along with their box art and viewer count.

I managed to do it, but I struggled getting the API passed in to the view, but with thanks to [@nikkilr88](https://twitter.com/nikkilr88) I managed to get it done, so a big thank you to her!

The app can be seen here: https://ancient-bastion-69677.herokuapp.com/

I finished off the evening with some MongoDB, and Mongoose was introduced; I'm looking forward to continuing on with that tomorrow!.
