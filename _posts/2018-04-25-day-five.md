## Today's Progress
I did a bit on HTTP requests, error, response, body etc.

Also had to mess around with Jekyll to change some stuff with the blog.  Not had a great deal of time but I managed about 40 minutes.


## Thoughts
The baby has colic so I wasn't able to do much this evening.  Luckily, I code during the wee small hours of the morning and I've got this evening to catch up.
