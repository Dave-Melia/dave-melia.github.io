## Today's Progress
I have done some algorithm scripting on FreeCodeCamp.


## Thoughts
Algorithm scripting isn't very enjoyable, but I'd imagine it's like having to eat your broccoli before you eat your dessert or having to limber up before going for a run... You want to get to the good stuff, but you need to do the boring stuff first.

After a couple of hours attempting several algorithms, I realise I'm awful at solving them without having to Google for help (partly solutions).  I wonder if it'll 'click' or if my brain just doesn't function that way.

I also need to spend time going over some regex as I have been avoiding it for years; even when I worked as a Linux Sysadmin I couldn't conjure up the motivation to learn it.

## Code Snippets

#### Title Case A String of Words

``` javascript
function toTitleCase(str) {
  return str.replace(/\w\S*/g, function(txt) {
    return txt.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + txt.substr(1).toLowerCase();
  });
}

toTitleCase('heLLO, DAVE');

// returns: Hello, Dave
```
