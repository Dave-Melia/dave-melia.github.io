## Today's Progress
More [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) lessons.  I've refactored the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) code with [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/).

## Thoughts
Not a lot to show for today, but I did learn more about [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/), and refactored my previous code using [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/).

I've added my first POST request to the API, which is now wired up to the database, as opposed to console.log'ing the body to the screen.

More [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) tomorrow, which I'm looking forward to.

My only concern is that I'm not spending enough time going over what I have learned, I'm forgetting stuff that I learned 2 days ago already!

I'm also worried that if I spend some time going over a design course, I'll start forgetting the [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) stuff.
