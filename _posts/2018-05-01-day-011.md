## Today's Progress
I progressed further with the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) tutorial, plus [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) was introduced.

## Thoughts
I am enjoying learning about [Express](https://expressjs.com/), however I am worried about remembering what I have learned, whilst also worrying about forgetting the stuff I've learned over the past 11 days.  Not feeling too bright this evening so I'm gonna keep the blog short for today <3
