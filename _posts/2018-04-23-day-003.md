## Today's Progress
I have refined my notes app and I have learned some of the methods of 'yargs'.

I have also managed to set up and configure this blog, however I had to set the post date of 'New Blog!' to the 20th to keep things in order.

## Thoughts

I am finding node packages a little intimidating at the moment.  I am also failing to see how I'm supposed to know that a package exists.  For example, if I didn't learn of the existence of yargs through a video I watched, how would I know about it and how would I know it's something I needed?

Time will tell, I presume!
