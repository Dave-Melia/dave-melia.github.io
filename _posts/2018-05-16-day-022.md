## Today's Progress
I continued on with my [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) course, and set up some GET requests, and test cases on the todo API.  The API has been uploaded to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/).

## Thoughts
I've had a blast setting up my todo API GET requests, you can GET all todos, as well as a single todo, using the route '/todos/:id'.

The app has been deployed to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), and the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) server has been set up through the [Heroku addon](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/) '[mLab MongoDB](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/mongolab)'.

Also, some test cases have been set up to ensure the correct data is being requested, and that a 404 will successfully show if using an invalid ObjectID or a todo wasn't found in the database.
