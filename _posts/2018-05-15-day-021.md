## Today's Progress
I decided to create my own API using what I have learned. Currently I have the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) schema set up, it saves the data, and console.log's it to the screen.

## Thoughts
As stated above, I created my own API of Alan Watt's quotes.  I currently only have a POST method in place, but it's working, and there's some test cases set up to ensure it's working correctly.

Tomorrow, I will work on the GET request, which should be as simple as using .find({})!

I also progressed with my [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) course so that I can figure out what to do next!

Lot of fun today; I can't wait to get back to it tomorrow!
