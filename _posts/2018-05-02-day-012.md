## Today's Progress
Today I have learned about [Express Middlewhere](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html), uploaded an app to [GitHub](https://github.com), and deployed it to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/)

## Thoughts
Well, as of today I am at the point where I usually give up.  My brain is fried, I am getting flustered and I'm feeling overwhelmed.

Following along with the course, it makes sense but when I attempt to make a dummy project to go over what I have learned, I am at a complete loss.

I feel like I can't just focus on one technology at a time, because on top of Node/Express, I've also got to learn Node packages and their methods, git commands, Heroku commands, routing, Handlebars, error handling, environment variables and so on and so on...!

It's very overwhelming because I can't just focus on one thing until I master it, each thing requires the next thing.

However, I am doing the [#100DaysofCode](http://100daysofcode.com/) challenge and therefore I am going to suck it up, and power through!
