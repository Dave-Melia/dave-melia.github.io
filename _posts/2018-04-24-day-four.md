## Today's Progress
I have spent some time learning the basics of async, call stack and event loop.

I have started to make a weather app using the Google Maps API, and I have learned how to beautify JSON callbacks (see below).

## Thoughts

async and call stack are quite intimidating at the moment and whilst it does make sense, I don't think I understand it enough.  I'm really excited to progress with the weather app and use the Google Maps API.

## Code Snippets

#### Pretty print JSON callbacks

> This works by adding spaces (2 in this case) to the string

``` javascript
request({
  url: 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=1301%20lombard%20street%20philadelphia',
  json: true
}, (error, response, body) => {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(body, undefined, 2));
});
```
