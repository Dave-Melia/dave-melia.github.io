## Today's Progress
I managed to lose count of my hours this evening, but I've done at least 3 hours.
I did some more [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) stuff and I've learned about connecting to the server, inserting data and removing data.
I learned about the 'deleteOne', 'deleteMany', 'findOneAndDelete', 'insertOne', and finding data based on certain criteria.

## Thoughts
I've had a lot of fun with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), and I think I'm understanding it.  Obviously there's a long way to go, but I'm happy with what I've learned thus far.

I did come away from the course and I attempted to connect and insert data from memory, but I needed to refer back for a few things.

A problem I have noticed, though, is that the course is using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) version 2.2.5, but when I referred to the docs for help, I noticed that version 3 no longer returns a database object as it did in version 2, but rather a client object.

The following is what I had learned as per v2:
``` javascript
  MongoClient.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/mytestingdb', (err, db) => {
    // Database returned
  });
```

And here is the client object as per v3:
``` javascript
  MongoClient.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017', (err, client) => {
    // Client returned
    var db = client.db('mytestingdb');
  });
```

Also, the close() method has been moved to the client:
``` javascript
  MongoClient.connect('mongodb://localhost', function (err, client) {
    if (err) throw err;

    var db = client.db('mytestingdb');

    db.collection('customers').findOne({}, function (findErr, result) {
      if (findErr) throw findErr;
      console.log(result.name);
      client.close();
    });
  });
```

This isn't a major ball-ache, but once the course is over, I think I'll have an adjustment period.

Furthermore, I decided to take a break from [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and returned to playing with [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) to finish up the evening.
I attempted to play with the [Twitch API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/) again, and have discovered that the data I needed was within response.data.data,
the second .data is an array which is what stifled me the other day when I couldn't access the data.
