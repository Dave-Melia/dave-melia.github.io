**Today's Progress**: Completed the NodeJS notes app.  Functionality includes adding, removing, viewing and listing notes.

**Thoughts** I have finished the NodeJS notes app and I have learned about using the NodeJS console and Chrome Dev Tools to debug the code.  Feeling accomplished, but it's 4:31am and I am exhausted!
